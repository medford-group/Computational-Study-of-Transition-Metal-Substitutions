List of things to address prior to submission to a journal:

1) Check HER activity -- is the selectivity challenge still an issue?

2) Get Pt into screening plots/tables. (plus other elements that are missing)

3) higher resolution calculations (550eV)

4) Check spin states for all magnetic elements (Ni, Co, Cr, Fe)
