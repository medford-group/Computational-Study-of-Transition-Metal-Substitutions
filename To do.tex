Results and Discussion

periodic table trends
volcano plots?
reorganize plots
d-band model

reaction pathways
reaction pathway diagrams
compare the rate limiting energy to other pathways previously found
histogram of rate limiting steps
plot rate limiting energy

voltage corrections
find rate limiting steps / energies
reactivity / stability diagrams for other rate limiting steps (N* for dissociative for example)
find limiting potential (to make rate limiting step zero)
find lowest surface (no hydrogens added) step energies, good for electrochemical catalysis

volcano plots

doping effects on voltage corrections, semiconductor physics, citations
