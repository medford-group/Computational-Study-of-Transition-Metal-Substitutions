abstract = {We describe an experimental method to probe the adsorption of water at the surface of isolated, substrate-free {TiO}$_2$ nanoparticles (NPs) based on soft X-ray spectroscopy in the gas phase using synchrotron radiation. To understand the interfacial properties between water and {TiO}$_2$ surface, a water shell was adsorbed at the surface of {TiO}$_2$ NPs. We used two different ways to control the hydration level of the NPs: in the first scheme, initially solvated NPs were dried and in the second one, dry NPs generated thanks to a commercial aerosol generator were exposed to water vapor. XPS was used to identify the signature of the water layer shell on the surface of the free {TiO}$_2$ NPs and made it possible to follow the evolution of their hydration state. The results obtained allow the establishment of a qualitative determination of isolated NPs' surface states, as well as to unravel water adsorption mechanisms. This method appears to be a unique approach to investigate the interface between an isolated nano-object and a solvent over-layer, paving the way towards new investigation methods in heterogeneous catalysis on nanomaterials.},

abstract = {The dependence of the surface properties of thin rutile {TiO}$_2$ (110) films on the number of layers in two- dimensional slab models has been investigated with first-principles methods based on density-functional theory. A pronounced oscillation of the interlayer distances, surface and adhesion energies, and electronic structure as a function of the number of layers has been found. The effect can be explained by surface-induced hybridization of Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals among the layers. This leads to reinforced interactions between the first and second layers and to weaker bonding and longer distances between the second and third layers of the films. By removing the 3d orbitals from the Ti basis set we found that {TiO}$_2$ behaves almost exactly as the isostructural SnO$_2$ (110) surface. The results are of importance for the properties of epitaxial ultrathin films grown on metal substrates as well as for single crystal surfaces.},

It is found that the preadsorbed Pt atom enhances significantly the adsorption of NH3, NH2 and H species on rutile {TiO}$_2$ (110) surface by binding with Pt adatom directly. It is also found that the first dissociation step of ammonia (NH3???NH2+H) on the clean rutile {TiO}$_2$ (110) surface is endothermic by 0.89eV, and no transition state exists. In addition, the first dissociation step of ammonia on Pt-covered rutile {TiO}$_2$ (110) surface is found to be endothermic by only 0.43eV, but presents an activation energy barrier of 1.82eV. A comparison of the adsorption and first dissociation step of ammonia on rutile {TiO}$_2$ (110) surface with and without Pt adatom has been discussed. Investigations indicate that the adsorbed Pt adatom on clean rutile {TiO}$_2$ (110) surface not only changes the surface electron structure, but also varies the reaction pathways by participating in the reaction. It is expected that our results would provide useful information for the development of catalyst for NH3 dissociation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Developing an accurate simulation method for the electrochemical stability of solids, as well as understanding the physics related with its accuracy, is critically important for improving the performance of compounds and predicting the stability of new materials in aqueous environments. Herein we propose a workflow for the accurate calculation of first-principles electrochemical phase (Pourbaix) diagrams. With this scheme, we study the electrochemical stabilities of Ti and Ti oxides using density-functional theory. First, we find the accuracy of an exchange-correlation functional in predicting formation energies and electrochemical stabilities is closely related with the electronic exchange interaction therein. Second, the metaGGA and hybrid functionals with a more precise description of the electronic exchange interaction lead to a systematic improvement in the accuracy of the Pourbaix diagrams. Furthermore, we show that accurate Ti Pourbaix diagrams also require that thermal effects are included through vibrational contributions to the free energy. We then use these diagrams to explain various experimental electrochemical phenomena for the Ti--O system, and show that if experimental formation energies for Ti oxides, which contain contributions from defects owing to their generation at high (combustion) temperatures, are directly used to predict room temperature Pourbaix diagrams then significant inaccuracies result. In contrast, the formation energies from accurate first-principles calculations, e.g., using metaGGA and hybrid functionals, are found to be more reliable. Finally to facilitate the future application of our accurate electrochemical phase equilibria diagrams, the variation of the Ti Pourbaix diagrams with aqueous ion concentration is also provided.},

abstract = {The initial step of O-2 evolution reaction on a {TiO}$_2$ surface is a long-standing puzzle. A recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment showed that the {H}$_2${O} molecule adsorbed on rutile {TiO}$_2$(110) surface could decompose under ultraviolet illumination (Tan, S. J.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 9978). The underlying reaction mechanism is now examined by our GGA+U study, in which the oxidation of the {H}$_2${O} molecule by both free and trapped holes has been carefully investigated. It is found that the transfer of the hole trapped at the bridge oxygen to the molecule is hindered by the mismatch between the energy and spatial symmetry of the trapped hole orbital and the highest occupied molecule orbital of {H}$_2${O}. The entire oxidation reaction has a high energy barrier and is barely exothermic. In contrast, the oxidation of the molecule by the free hole is energetically more favorable. The free hole is transferred to the {H}$_2${O} molecule via the in-plane oxygen atom when the molecule stays in the transient dissociation state. This mechanism may also be applicable to the photooxidation of other R OH type molecules adsorbed on the rutile {TiO}$_2$(110) surface.},

NO readily reacts on {TiO}$_2$(110) to form N$_2$O, which desorbs between 50 and 200??K (LT N$_2$O channels), which leaves the {TiO}$_2$ surface populated with adsorbed oxygen atoms (Oa) as a by-product of N$_2$O formation. In addition, we observe simultaneous desorption peaks of NO and N$_2$O at 270??K (HT1 N$_2$O) and 400??K (HT2 N$_2$O), respectively, both of which are attributed to reaction-limited processes. No N-derived reaction product desorbs from {TiO}$_2$(110) surface above 500??K or higher, while the surface may be populated with Oa's and oxidized products such as NO$_2$ and NO3. The adsorbate-free {TiO}$_2$ surface with oxygen vacancies can be regenerated by prolonged annealing at 850??K or higher. Detailed analysis of the three N$_2$O desorption yields reveals that the surface species for the HT channels are likely to be various forms of NO dimers.},

abstract = {We study the energetics and structure of water absorption on the ideal rutile {TiO}$_2$ (110) surface using dispersion-corrected periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and on-site Coulomb potential (DFT+U) corrections. Conventional (PBE) and self-consistent dispersion-corrected DFT methods (vdw-DF1 and vdw-DF2) both suggest that molecular adsorption of intact water molecules on the rutile (110) surface is increasingly preferred with increasing simulation slab thickness. However, empirical dispersion corrections indicate a mix of molecular and dissociated water may coexist at room temperature, with less dependence on slab thickness. This same behavior is seen for DFT+U with U = 3 eV in combination with or without self-consistent dispersion corrected DFT. We find that the preference for the occurrence of dissociated water increases with increasing U. When compared with experimental bond-length data for the adsorbed water species, none of the methods and slab thicknesses correctly predict all bond lengths simultaneously. However, of the methods that energetically favor coexisting associated and dissociated water species on the surface, the three-layer slab with conventional DFT (PBE) and the empirically dispersion-corrected DFT methods come closest to correctly reproducing all of the experimentally observed bond lengths. We conclude that the current level of DFT is insufficient to definitively distinguish between the fully associated and partially dissociated states of water adsorbed on the pristine rutile (110) surface, due to the very small (0.1 eV) total energy differences between these states.},

S.; Bredow, T.; Ivashkevich, O. A.; Matulis, V. E. J. Phys. Chem. C. 2012, DOI: 10.1021/jp308393p]. Two complementary theoretical approaches were employed based on plane waves and on the linear combination of Gaussian-type orbitals, respectively. NO adsorption on the rutile(110) surface covered with Agn clusters (n = 2, 4, 8) was studied. For Ag8/rutile(110), two energetically most stable adsorption sites were found: at the border between the silver cluster and the surface and on the silver particles. In the absence of reducing agents, the further stages of NO decomposition are similar to those obtained on Ag/anatase(100). The adsorption of an additional NO molecule results in the formation of an acyclic cis-ONNO dimer. This is followed by the fragmentation of (NO)2 by breaking one or two N-O bonds. The main product of the on-cluster decomposition is molecular nitrogen, while at-border decomposition leads to the formation of N$_2$O. In the on-cluster case, a rather stable dimer structure is formed, which is not directly decomposed. This intermediate can only be decomposed after isomerization to other dimer structures. Similar to the case of Ag/anatase(100), the Ag/rutile(110) surface is oxidized by remaining O atoms after NO decomposition. These O atoms can form NO$_2$ according to an Eley-Rideal mechanism with other NO molecules adsorbed from the gas phase. From the calculated reaction energies, it is concluded that NO conversion on Ag/anatase(100) is more feasible than on Ag/rutile(110).},

Adsorption energy scaling relations and Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships are established and used to place Mo 2C into the context of transition metal surfaces. The results indicate that the surface termination is a complex function of reaction conditions and kinetics. It is predicted that the surface will be covered by either C 2H 2 or O depending on conditions. Comparisons with transition metals indicate that the Mo-terminated Mo 2C(0 0 1) surface exhibits carbon reactivity similar to transition metals such as Ru and Ir, but is significantly more reactive toward oxygen.

abstract = {XPS and periodic DFT calculations have been used to investigate water sorption on the {TiO}$_2$ rutile (1 1 0) face. Two sets of XPS spectra were collected on the {TiO}$_2$ (1 1 0) single crystal clean and previously exposed to water: the first set with photoelectrons collected in a direction parallel to the normal to the surface; and the second set with the sample tilted by 70, respectively. This tilting procedure promotes the signals from surface species and reveals that the first hydration layer is strongly coordinated to the surface and also that, despite the fact that the spectra were recorded under ultra-high vacuum, water molecules subsist in upper hydration layers. In addition, periodic DFT calculations were performed to investigate the water adsorption process to determine if molecular and/or dissociative adsorption takes place. The first step of the theoretical part was the optimisation of a dry surface model and then the investigation of water adsorption. The calculated molecular water adsorption energies are consistent with previously published experimental data and it appears that even though it is slightly less stable, the dissociative water sorption can also take place. This assumption was considered, in a second step, on a larger surface model where molecular and dissociated water molecules were adsorbed together with different ratio. It was found that, due to hydrogen bonding stabilisation, molecular and dissociated water molecules can coexist on the surface if the ratio of dissociated water molecules is less than 33{\%}. These results are consistent with previous experimental works giving a 10-25{\%} range. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Methanol is oxidised to formaldehyde by the Formox process, in which molybdenum oxides, usually doped with iron, are the catalyst. The active phase of the catalysts and the reasons for the selectivity observed are still unknown. We present a density functional theory based study that indicates the unique character of Mo(VI)-Mo(IV) pairs as the most active and selective sites and indicates the active sites on the surface, the controlling factors of selectivity, and the role of the dopant. Iron reduces the energy requirements of the redox Mo(VI)Mo(IV) pair by acting as an electron reservoir that sets in if required. Our present study paves the way towards a better understanding of the process.},

The photoactivity of the adsorbed molecule is dependent on the N$_2$O coverage. At low coverages, the adsorbed N$_2$O is photodepleted to produce adsorbed nitrogen. Larger coverages of N$_2$O are not photodepleted to N$_2$ due to the site blocking in the adsorption process. N-bonded species show a higher photoreactivity than the O-bonded species.

abstract = {Recently several theoretical studies have examined oxygen adsorption on the clean, reduced {TiO}$_2$(110) surface. However the photocatalytic behavior of {TiO}$_2$ and the scavenging ability of oxygen are known to be influenced by the presence of surface hydroxyls. In this paper the chemistry of O$_2$ on the hydroxylated {TiO}$_2$ surface is investigated by means of first-principles total energy calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. TheMD trajectories show a direct, spontaneous reaction between O$_2$ and the surface hydroxyls, thus supporting the experimental hypothesis that the reaction does not necessarily pass through a chemisorbed O$_2$ state. Following this reaction, the most stable chemisorbed intermediates are found to be peroxide species HO$_2$ and {H}$_2${O}$_2$. Although these intermediates are very stable on the short time scale of MD simulations, the energetics suggests that their further transformation is connected to a new 300 K feature observed in the experimental water temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum. The participation of two less stable intermediate states, involving terminal hydroxyls and/or chemisorbed water plus oxygen adatoms, to the desorption process, is not supported by the total energy calculations. Analysis of the projected density of states, however, suggests the possibility that these intermediates have a role in completing the surface oxidation immediately before desorption. Introduction},

The optimized 2D lattice constants of the unconstrained slabs eventually converge to the attached bulk value. The total energy difference reveals that, with odd number trilayers, the unconstrained slab is much closer to the corresponding constrained slab. The surface energies both converge to the individual values with the number of atomic layers. Key},

abstract = {Electrochemical potential/pH (Pourbaix) diagrams underpin many aqueous electrochemical processes and are central to the identification of stable phases of metals for processes ranging from electrocatalysis to corrosion. Even though standard DFT calculations are potentially powerful tools for the prediction of such diagrams, inherent errors in the description of transition metal (hydroxy)oxides, together with neglect of van der Waals interactions, have limited the reliability of such predictions for even the simplest pure metal bulk compounds, and corresponding predictions for more complex alloy or surface structures are even more challenging. In the present work, through synergistic use of a Hubbard U correction, a state-of-the-art dispersion correction, and a water-based bulk reference state for the calculations, these errors are systematically corrected. The approach describes the weak binding that occurs between hydroxyl-containing functional groups in certain compounds in Pourbaix diagrams, corrects for self-interaction errors in transition metal compounds, and reduces residual errors on oxygen atoms by preserving a consistent oxidation state between the reference state, water, and the relevant bulk phases. The strong performance is illustrated on a series of bulk transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) hydroxides, oxyhydroxides, binary, and ternary oxides, where the corresponding thermodynamics of redox and (de)hydration are described with standard errors of 0.04 eV per reaction formula unit. The approach further preserves accurate descriptions of the overall thermodynamics of electrochemically relevant bulk reactions, such as water formation, which is an essential condition for facilitating accurate analysis of reaction energies for electrochemical processes on surfaces. The overall generality and transferability of the scheme suggests that it may find useful application in the construction of a broad array of electrochemical phase diagrams, including both bulk Pourbaix diagrams and surface phase diagrams of interest for corrosion and electrocatalysis},

abstract = {The interaction of water with the (110) crystal face of {TiO}$_2$ (rutile) was examined with high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). Water desorption occurred in three sequential TPD features as a function of exposure at 270, 175 and 155 K, ascribed to monolayer, second layer and multilayer states, respectively. Estimation of the extent to which water molecularly versus dissociatively adsorbed on the {TiO}$_2$(110) surface was attempted by comparing HREELS and TPD data. Very low water exposures (below 7 x 1013molecules/cm2) dissociatively adsorbed at 135 K to surface hydroxyl groups (v(OH) = 3690 cm- 1), but molecular adsorption (v(OH) = 3420 - 3505 cm- 1 and $\delta$(HOH) = 1625 cm- 1) resulted from additional water exposure. The appearance of molecular water in HREELS coincided with a red-shift in the OH stretching frequency of the hydroxyl, presumably due to the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions with the adsorbed water molecules. Little or no additional water dissociation occurred during heating of the monolayer as inferred from HREELS. Second layer water on {TiO}$_2$(110) was evident in HREELS by OH stretching intensity below 3400 cm- 1 indicative of hydrogen-bonding. However, the OH stretching mode of monolayer water molecules was not red-shifted by the presence of second layer water suggesting that protons on monolayer water molecules were not involved in hydrogen-bonding second layer water molecules. The influence of second layer water on subsequent layers was evident in both HREELS and TPD.},

The aim of the work is to elucidate the factors that determine whether the adsorption is molecular or dissociative, including the acidity of the molecule, the geometry and electrostatic properties of the surface, and the interaction between adsorbed species. It is shown that the theoretical methods reproduce experimental values of the gas-phase heterolytic and homolytic dissociation energies to reasonable accuracy (within ∼20kJmol−1 for all four molecules). We find that the adsorption energy for the most favourable molecular mode of adsorption is extremely close to that for dissociative adsorption in the cases of {H}$_2${O}, CH3OH and {H}$_2${O}$_2$. For HCO$_2$H, dissociative adsorption is favoured by a substantial margin, provided the dissociated geometry preserves the equivalence of the two oxygens in the formate ion. It is also shown that the geometry of the {TiO}$_2$(110) surface plays a crucial role in determining the conformations of the most stable geometries, and that hydrogen bonding between adsorbed species is also important.},

TiO 2 has been the most widely-researched photocatalyst, but suffers from low efficiency and narrow light response range. Combining {TiO}$_2$ with carbonaceous nanomaterials is being increasingly investigated as a means to increase photocatalytic activity, and demonstrations of enhancement are plentiful. This review surveys the literature and highlights recent progress in the development of nanocarbon-{TiO}$_2$ photocatalysts, covering activated carbon, carbon doping, carbon nanotubes, [60]-fullerenes, graphene, thin layer carbon coating, nanometric carbon black and more recently developed morphologies. Mechanisms of enhancement, synthesis routes and future applications are summarised and discussed. New insight and enhanced photocatalytic activity may be provided by novel nanocarbon-{TiO}$_2$ systems. Ongoing challenges and possible new directions are outlined. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nitrogen fixation is essential for the synthesis of many important chemicals (e.g., fertilizers, explosives) and basic building blocks for all forms of life (e.g., nucleotides for DNA and RNA, amino acids for proteins). However, direct nitrogen fixation is challenging as nitrogen (N₂) does not easily react with other chemicals. By dry ball-milling graphite with N₂, we have discovered a simple, but versatile, scalable and eco-friendly, approach to direct fixation of N₂ at the edges of graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs). The mechanochemical cracking of graphitic C--C bonds generated active carbon species that react directly with N₂ to form five- and six-membered aromatic rings at the broken edges, leading to solution-processable edge-nitrogenated graphene nanoplatelets (NGnPs) with superb catalytic performance in both dye-sensitized solar cells and fuel cells to replace conventional Pt-based catalysts for energy conversion.},

Remarkably, HGCNOS exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than pristine graphitic carbon nitride (GCN). Oxygen doping caused semicrystalline structure, making exciton dissociated at the order-disorder interfaces of HGCNOS and releasing more electrons and holes. Furthermore, the conduction band position of HGCNOS was elevated by sulfur doping, promoting the reduction ability of HGCNOS. Thus, the special electronic and physicochemical structure of HGCNOS contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic activity, facilitating its application on nitrogen photofixation.},

abstract = {Recent experimental studies have determined that carbon doping dramatically improves the photocatalytic activity of {TiO}$_2$ in the visible-light region. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the generalized gradient corrected approximation, we investigate various structural models of carbon impurities in both the anatase and rutile polymorphs of {TiO}$_2$ and analyze the associated modifications of the electronic band structure. We compare the stability of all these diverse species on the basis of their energy of formation as a function of the oxygen chemical potential, which determines whether the system is in an oxidizing or reducing environment. At low carbon concentrations, we find that, under oxygen-poor conditions, substitutional (to oxygen) carbon and oxygen vacancies are favored, whereas, under oxygen-rich conditions, interstitial and substitutional (to Ti) C atoms are preferred. Higher carbon concentrations undergo an unexpected stabilization caused by multicloping effects, interpreted as inter-species redox processes. Carbon impurities result in modest variations of the band gap but induce several localized occupied states in the (lap, which may account for the experimentally observed red shift of the absorption edge toward the visible. Our results also indicate that carbon doping may favor the formation of oxygen vacancies in bulk {TiO}$_2$.},

We synthesized a chemically modified n-type {TiO}$_2$ by controlled combustion of Ti metal in a natural gas flame. This material, in which carbon substitutes for some of the lattice oxygen atoms, absorbs light at wavelengths below 535 nanometers and has a lower band-gap energy than rutile (2.32 versus 3.00 electron volts). At an applied potential of 0.3 volt, chemically modified n-type {TiO}$_2$ performs water splitting with a total conversion efficiency of 11{\%} and a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 8.35{\%} when illuminated at 40 milliwatts per square centimeter. The latter value compares favorably with a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 1{\%} for n-type {TiO}$_2$ biased at 0.6 volt.},

In C-doped {TiO}$_2$ with C@O, the band gap changes slightly, but the doped carbon introduces spin-polarized gap states of C 2p orbital in character. Thus, the associated electron excitations among the valence band, the conduction band, and the gap states explain the various visible-light absorption thresholds observed for C anion-doped {TiO}$_2$. For C-doped anatase and rutile {TiO}$_2$ with C@Ti, the doped C atom does not induce spin-polarized states. For C-doped anatase {TiO}$_2$ with C@Ti, the optical absorption energy is reduced by about 0.18 eV, and the C dopant forms a linear O-C-O unit with short C-O distance resembling carbon dioxide, which is consistent with experiment. In C-doped rutile {TiO}$_2$ with C@Ti, C-doping reduces the optical absorption energy by about 0.3 eV.},

abstract = {Titanium dioxide ({TiO}$_2$) has been widely investigated as a photocatalyst material because of its stability and hypotoxicity. However, the photocatalytic activity of {TiO}$_2$is suppressed by the large band gap and the high recombination rate of the charge carrier, which leads to confined application. Moreover, how to improve photocatalytic H2production without any co-catalyst remains a big challenge. Here, we report a conceptual strategy in a core–shell nanostructure of simultaneously reducing the band gap and the charge carrier recombination rate by introducing a carbon-doped porous {TiO}$_2$layer onto a metallic TiC nanostructure using a facile in situ thermal growth method. TiC@C-{TiO}$_2$core–shell nanostructure materials have higher photocatalytic activity in methanol aqueous solution than those of pure P25 and carbon-doped {TiO}$_2$, which results from enhanced visible light absorption, drastic charge transfer, and the large surface area. Notably, the novel core–shell nanostructures still exhibit excellent photocatalytic H2production without Pt co-catalyst. The results demonstrate that TiC is an ideal support for {TiO}$_2$photocatalysts, and this novel core–shell nanostructure can significantly shift the position of the band edge of the obtained material. This study presents a design principle for photocatalytic materials as highly efficient visible light photocatalysts.},

abstract = {C-doped and C- and V-doped {TiO}$_2$photocatalysts were prepared by a sol-gel process. Both catalysts showed high activity for the degradation of acetaldehyde under visible irradiation ({\textgreater} 420  nm). The co-doped {TiO}$_2$catalysts also were highly active in the dark; 2.0{\%} V-containing co-doped {TiO}$_2$had the highest activity, comparable with the activity under visible light irradiation. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and N$_2$adsorption-desorption. The results suggest that vanadium ions were introduced both on the surface and into the bulk of {TiO}$_2$. A free electron, induced by the formation of V5+in the sublayers of {TiO}$_2$during calcination at 500 °C in air, was delocalized and promoted into the conduction band by thermal energy and further transferred to O$_2$, generating a superoxide radical anion (Oṡ-2) that is responsible for degradation of acetaldehyde in the dark. In addition to functioning as a photosensitizer that shifts the optical response of {TiO}$_2$from the ultraviolet (UV) to the visible light region, the doped elemental carbon increased the surface area and improved the dispersion of vanadium. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we propose an in situ synthetic strategy for the construct of carbon-doped {TiO}$_2$single crystal nanorods using CPS/{TiO}$_2$as the precursors of {TiO}$_2$nanorods and carbon source via a facile hydrothermal route. This technique involves the preparation of cationic polystyrene spheres (CPS), sequential deposition of {TiO}$_2$precursor, hydrothermal reaction, and the pyrolysis of CPS in a N$_2$atmosphere at 450°C. The morphology and structure of as-prepared C-{TiO}$_2$single crystal nanorods were characterized by TEM, SEM, STEM Mapping, XRD, UV–vis spectroscopy, and XPS. All results confirm the carbon doping in the as-prepared {TiO}$_2$single crystal nanorods. As a result of unique microstructure, the resulting {TiO}$_2$exhibits remarkably visible-light photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of organic pollutants including methylene blue (MB), Rhodamine B (RhB) and p-nitrophenol (PNP). Therefore, the current study provides a new insight for incorporating dopants into the {TiO}$_2$single crystals lattice.},

In C-doped {TiO}$_2$ with C@O, the band gap changes slightly, but the doped carbon introduces spin-polarized gap states of C 2p orbital in character. Thus, the associated electron excitations among the valence band, the conduction band, and the gap states explain the various visible-light absorption thresholds observed for C anion-doped {TiO}$_2$. For C-doped anatase and rutile {TiO}$_2$ with C@Ti, the doped C atom does not induce spin-polarized states. For C-doped anatase {TiO}$_2$ with C@Ti, the optical absorption energy is reduced by about 0.18 eV, and the C dopant forms a linear O-C-O unit with short C-O distance resembling carbon dioxide, which is consistent with experiment. In C-doped rutile {TiO}$_2$ with C@Ti, C-doping reduces the optical absorption energy by about 0.3 eV.},

The photocatalytic performances of {TiO}$_2$/CB catalysts were also found better than those of {TiO}$_2$incorporated with activated carbon.

abstract = {Carbon catalyses many reactions, mainly oxidation reactions with oxygen and with halogens, e.g. SO$_2$ + 1202 → SO3, or CO + Cl2→ COCl2. It is known, however, that different carbons behave quite differently in the reduction of oxygen on fuel cell cathodes. Therefore the catalytic activity of carbons has been studied in other reactions. A convenient test reaction is the oxidation of dilute aqueous sulphurous acid. It became apparent that all catalytically active carbons contain small quantities of nitrogen, and inactive carbons such as wood charcoal or carbon blacks can be rendered highly active by treatment with N H3 or HCN at elevated temperatures. Photoelectron spectra indicate that the catalytic activity increases parallel to the incorporation of a nitrogen species which is pyridine-like, i.e. incorporated in the aromatic layers. Treatment with NH3 at 900 °C leads also to massive gasification of the carbons, increasing their surface area. Other reactions studied included the oxidation of aqueous oxalic acid and of methanol to formaldehyde. A quite different type of reaction is the elimination of hydrogen chloride from 1-chloroalkanes, e.g. 1 -chlorobutane. Again, activity changes in parallel to nitrogen content. Reaction products are olefins, dimers of the alkyl groups, and a polymer on the catalyst surface. The formation of alkyl dimers, e.g. n-octane in the case of n-butylchloride, suggests that radicals are involved in the reaction.},

abstract = {Graphite oxide (GO) was synthesized from commercial graphite and modified by calcinations at 350 °C. The samples were used as adsorbents of ammonia at dry and moist conditions. Their surface before and after exposure to ammonia was characterized using adsorption of nitrogen, XRD, SEM, FTIR, TA, CHN analysis, and potentiometric titration. The results showed that oxidation results in the incorporation of a significant amount of epoxy, phenolic, and carboxylic groups, which is directly manifested by a decrease in surface pH. The majority of the latter is removed by calcinations. During this process, the exfoliation of graphite occurs, resulting in the formation of some micro- and mesporosity. The materials obtained have proven to be excellent adsorbents of ammonia. The NH3 reacts with carboxylic acids and is intercalated between layers or dissolved in pores with adsorbed water. The mechanism depends on the conditions of experiments and surface features of the samples. The highest capacity is obtained on GO on which a significant amount of water is adsorbed, likely on functional groups. This helps in the dissociation of carboxylic groups and their acid−base reactions with ammonia. Nevertheless, a significant amount of ammonia is intercalated between layers. Those two interactions are the strongest. When water is present in the challenge gas, the amount adsorbed decreases because of the competition between water and ammonia for active sites.},

Differences were found in the core and valence-band region indicating a highly graphitic and almost unoxidized nature for untreated pitch-based fibers. The graphite samples were found to have more reactive surfaces than the pitch fibers. X-ray powder diffraction was used to study the bulk structures of these materials, and the Du Pont E-120 pitch-based fiber was found to have the most graphitic structure of all the carbon fibers examined. The anodic oxidation of the pitch fiber changed both surface and bulk structure, producing mainly one type of oxygen-containing group on the surface.},

abstract = {A NORIT activated carbon was modified by different chemical and thermal treatments (including oxidation in the gas and liquid phases) in order to obtain materials with different surface properties. Several techniques were used to characterize these materials including nitrogen adsorption, chemical and thermal analyses, XPS, TPD and DRIFTS. The results obtained by TPD agree quantitatively with the elemental and proximate analyses of the oxidized materials, and qualitatively with the observations by DRIFTS. A simple deconvolution method is proposed to analyse the TPD spectra, allowing for the quantitative determination of the amount of each functional group on the surface. A multiple gaussian function has been shown to fit the data adequately, the parameters obtained for each fit matching very well the features observed in the experimentally determined TPD spectra. It is shown that gas phase oxidation of the carbon increases mainly the concentration of hydroxyl and carbonyl surface groups, while oxidations in the liquid phase increase especially the concentration of carboxylic acids.},

Remarkably, HGCNOS exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than pristine graphitic carbon nitride (GCN). Oxygen doping caused semicrystalline structure, making exciton dissociated at the order-disorder interfaces of HGCNOS and releasing more electrons and holes. Furthermore, the conduction band position of HGCNOS was elevated by sulfur doping, promoting the reduction ability of HGCNOS. Thus, the special electronic and physicochemical structure of HGCNOS contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic activity, facilitating its application on nitrogen photofixation.},

abstract = {Nitrogen fixation is essential for the synthesis of many important chemicals (e.g., fertilizers, explosives) and basic building blocks for all forms of life (e.g., nucleotides for DNA and RNA, amino acids for proteins). However, direct nitrogen fixation is challenging as nitrogen (N₂) does not easily react with other chemicals. By dry ball-milling graphite with N₂, we have discovered a simple, but versatile, scalable and eco-friendly, approach to direct fixation of N₂ at the edges of graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs). The mechanochemical cracking of graphitic C--C bonds generated active carbon species that react directly with N₂ to form five- and six-membered aromatic rings at the broken edges, leading to solution-processable edge-nitrogenated graphene nanoplatelets (NGnPs) with superb catalytic performance in both dye-sensitized solar cells and fuel cells to replace conventional Pt-based catalysts for energy conversion.},

@article{Stohr1991,
abstract = {The catalytic activity of activated carbons in oxidation reactions with O$_2$is enhanced after treatment with NH3or HCN at elevated temperatures (600-900°C). The oxidation of dilute aqueous H2SO3was measured as a test of catalytic activity. Nitrogen is chemisorbed in the treatment and XPS showed two N 1s signals with binding energies of 401-400 eV and 399-398 eV which are assigned to amine groups and nitrile and/or pyridine-like nitrogen, respectively. In the case of HCN treatment, the N content was higher on the surface than in the bulk and the accessible micropore volume was reduced. It could be reopened by heating in N$_2$to 900°C. The catalytic activity was significantly increased after heating in {H}$_2${O}r N$_2$to 900°C although the N content was considerably reduced. The carbon is partly gasified in the reaction with NH3at 900°C leading to an increase of the pore volume in the micropore range. Thermodesorption experiments with {H}$_2${O}, adsorbed at 300 K and N$_2$and O$_2$adsorbed at ca. 80 K gave evidence of the presence of very narrow micropores of molecular dimensions in the NH3-activated carbon. With O$_2$, a desorption peak for a reversibly chemisorbed O$_2$species was observed at 190-210 K with measurable desorption extending to T {\textgreater} 300 K. This desorption peak was also observed with O$_2$adsorbed on HOPG. XPS measurements at T {\textless} 170 K showed a signal at an O 1s b.e. of 533 eV which is assigned to O$_2$-ions. The NH3-activated carbon catalyzed {H}$_2${O} formation from H2and O$_2$at T {\textless} 170 K. Further chemical evidence for the presence of O$_2$is described. In addition, it was found that also synthetic graphite of fine particle size catalyzed H2SO3oxidation. The catalytic activity seems to be enhanced by chemisorbed nitrogen atoms, but the concentration of the active species is below the limits of XPS detection. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {This review highlights recent developments and future perspectives in carbon dioxide usage for the sustainable production of energy and chemicals and to reduce global warming. We discuss the heterogeneously catalysed hydrogenation, as well as the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic conversion of CO$_2$ to hydrocarbons or oxygenates. Various sources of hydrogen are also reviewed in terms of their CO$_2$ neutrality. Technologies have been developed for large-scale CO$_2$ hydrogenation to methanol or methane. Their industrial application is, however, limited by the high price of renewable hydrogen and the availability of large-volume sources of pure CO$_2$. With regard to the direct electrocatalytic reduction of CO$_2$ to value-added chemicals, substantial advances in electrodes, electrolyte, and reactor design are still required to permit the development of commercial processes. Therefore, in this review particular attention is paid to (i) the design of metal electrodes to improve their performance and (ii) recent developments of alternative approaches such as the application of ionic liquids as electrolytes and of microorganisms as co-catalysts. The most significant improvements both in catalyst and reactor design are needed for the photocatalytic functionalisation of CO$_2$ to become a viable technology that can help in the usage of CO$_2$ as a feedstock for the production of energy and chemicals. Apart from technological aspects and catalytic performance, we also discuss fundamental strategies for the rational design of materials for effective transformations of CO$_2$ to value-added chemicals with the help of H2, electricity and/or light.},

@article{White2015,
abstract = {A wide variety of semiconductor systems have proven capable of harnessing near-ultraviolet and visible light and using that energy to drive the reduction of carbon dioxide through photocatalysis or photoelectrochemistry. The improved production of solar fuels is an essential component of the renewable energy portfolio of the future, enabling intermittent power sources to become more prevalent by storing excess energy with fewer losses and thus greater recoverability. Whereas early research in this field employed suspensions of simple semiconductor materials in aqueous solution, recent developments have focused on various doping and nanostructuring techniques, combinations of multiple semiconductors, and the addition of heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts and sensitizers. The use of nanomaterials in particular has led to improved charge separation and to enhanced catalysis. Metals, both directly in contact with the light absorber and in a separate but electrically connected electrolysis cell, serve as electron sinks and catalysts, and they sometimes even enable CO$_2$ reduction on semiconductors whose own surfaces have excessively high overpotentials. Many of the semiconductors described in this review are oxides, with {TiO}$_2$ receiving the bulk of scrutiny in this regard. Often these materials have band gaps approaching 3 eV; this hinders the absorption of a large proportion of the solar spectrum available at the Earth's surface and diminishes the insolation to current efficiency. The efficiency of smaller band gap (∼1.3 eV) semiconductors is still capped at the Shockley− Queiesser limit of ∼30{\%}.363 Therefore, multijunction cells may be necessary to capture the majority of the solar spectrum, overcome the SQ limit, maintain long-term stability under illumination, and still straddle the CO$_2$ reduction and {H}$_2${O} oxidation potentials. Although some efforts have already been made to find working combinations of semiconductors (section 2.5), much of the domain of pairs (or even multiples) has yet to be explored. Some of the innovations recently taken up in photocatalysis, such as photosensitization, were first studied for use in photovoltaics. Another such innovation, the use of organic semiconductors (OSCs), has, to our knowledge, not yet been employed in CO$_2$ reduction catalysis. Although organic photovoltaics are still less efficient than silicon,425 the use of these semiconductors in catalysis may prove to be particularly interesting due to their mutability. The vast scope of synthetic methods available permits tuning of the electronics,426 but functional groups could also be appended to bind and reduce CO$_2$ more effectively. As diverse as these studies have been, the vast majority of CO$_2$-reduced products are single-carbon species such as methane, methanol, carbon monoxide, and formic acid. Some multicarbon products, primarily light hydrocarbons, have been reported to form, although they are generated almost exclusively at metallic copper and typically in low yields. Whereas the established Fischer−Tropsch process is capable of taking solar-generated CO and H2 to liquids, an important advance in catalysis would be the development of materials that can make carbon−carbon bonds and, thus, higher order hydrocarbons and alcohols at ambient conditions directly from CO$_2$, water, and light.},

abstract = {Abstract The production of ammonia (NH3) from molecular dinitrogen (N$_2$) under mild conditions is one of the most attractive topics in the field of chemistry. Electrochemical reduction of N$_2$ is promising for achieving clean and sustainable NH3 production with lower energy consumption using renewable energy sources. To date, emerging electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of N$_2$ to NH3 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure remain largely underexplored. The major challenge is to achieve both high catalytic activity and high selectivity. Here, the recent progress on the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at ambient temperature and pressure from both theoretical and experimental aspects is summarized, aiming at extracting instructive perceptions for future NRR research activities. The prevailing theories and mechanisms for NRR as well as computational screening of promising materials are presented. State-of-the-art heterogeneous electrocatalysts as well as rational design of the whole electrochemical systems for NRR are involved. Importantly, promising strategies to enhance the activity, selectivity, efficiency, and stability of electrocatalysts toward NRR are proposed. Moreover, ammonia determination methods are compared and problems relating to possible ammonia contamination of the system are mentioned so as to shed fresh light on possible standard protocols for NRR measurements.},

Here{,} the two reactions are introduced into one photocatalytic system{,} which achieves the simultaneous utilization of photo-induced electrons and holes. The mechanism results demonstrate that photo-induced electrons contribute to the production of H2{,} while holes contribute to the conversion of CH4. This work provides a new strategy for photocatalytic reactions{,} and provides considerable quantum efficiencies for electrons of 2.83\% (without a sacrificial agent) and holes of 2.76\%. In view of the closed values of the quantum efficiencies for the two original photo-induced species{,} it is believed that the separated electrons and holes are more effectively utilized."}

  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

In light of the targets set out by the Paris Climate Agreement and the global energy sector's ongoing transition from fossil fuels to renewables, the chemical industry is searching for innovative ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of ammonia. To address this need, research and development is under way around the world to replace the century-old Haber-Bosch process for manufacturing ammonia from N$_2$ and H2, powered by renewable electricity. This involves replacing H2 obtained from steam-reformed CH4 to H2 that is instead obtained from electrolyzed {H}$_2${O}. This transition will enable the changeover from the Haber-Bosch production of NH3 to electrochemical, plasma chemical, thermochemical, and photochemical generation of NH3. If ammonia can eventually be produced directly from N$_2$ and {H}$_2${O} powered by just sunlight, at a technologically significant scale, efficiency, and cost, in a “solar ammonia refinery,” green ammonia can change the world!"

abstract = {Systematic temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies of NO adsorption and reactions on rutile {TiO}$_2$(110)-1??????1 surface reveal several distinct reaction channels in a temperature range of 50???500??K. NO readily reacts on {TiO}$_2$(110) to form N$_2$O, which desorbs between 50 and 200??K (LT N$_2$O channels), which leaves the {TiO}$_2$ surface populated with adsorbed oxygen atoms (Oa) as a by-product of N$_2$O formation. In addition, we observe simultaneous desorption peaks of NO and N$_2$O at 270??K (HT1 N$_2$O) and 400??K (HT2 N$_2$O), respectively, both of which are attributed to reaction-limited processes. No N-derived reaction product desorbs from {TiO}$_2$(110) surface above 500??K or higher, while the surface may be populated with Oa's and oxidized products such as NO$_2$ and NO3. The adsorbate-free {TiO}$_2$ surface with oxygen vacancies can be regenerated by prolonged annealing at 850??K or higher. Detailed analysis of the three N$_2$O desorption yields reveals that the surface species for the HT channels are likely to be various forms of NO dimers.},

    abstract = { ▪ Abstract The powerful computational resources available to scientists today, together with recent improvements in electronic structure calculation algorithms, are providing important new tools for researchers in the fields of surface science and catalysis. In this review, we discuss first principles calculations that are now capable of providing qualitative and, in many cases, quantitative insights into surface chemistry. The calculations can aid in the establishment of chemisorption trends across the transition metals, in the characterization of reaction pathways on individual metals, and in the design of novel catalysts. First principles studies provide an excellent fundamental complement to experimental investigations of the above phenomena and can often allow the elucidation of important mechanistic details that would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine from experiments alone. }

abstract  ="The activity of many heterogeneous catalysts is limited by strong correlations between activation energies and adsorption energies of reaction intermediates. Although the reaction is thermodynamically favourable at ambient temperature and pressure{,} the catalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3){,} a fertilizer and chemical fuel{,} from N$_2$ and H2 requires some of the most extreme conditions of the chemical industry. We demonstrate how ammonia can be produced at ambient pressure from air{,} water{,} and concentrated sunlight as renewable source of process heat via nitrogen reduction with a looped metal nitride{,} followed by separate hydrogenation of the lattice nitrogen into ammonia. Separating ammonia synthesis into two reaction steps introduces an additional degree of freedom when designing catalysts with desirable activation and adsorption energies. We discuss the hydrogenation of alkali and alkaline earth metal nitrides and the reduction of transition metal nitrides to outline a promoting role of lattice hydrogen in ammonia evolution. This is rationalized via electronic structure calculations with the activity of nitrogen vacancies controlling the redox-intercalation of hydrogen and the formation and hydrogenation of adsorbed nitrogen species. The predicted trends are confirmed experimentally with evolution of 56.3{,} 80.7{,} and 128 μmol NH3 per mol metal per min at 1 bar and above 550 °C via reduction of Mn6N$_2$.58 to Mn4N and hydrogenation of Ca3N$_2$ and Sr2N to Ca2NH and SrH2{,} respectively."}

The high efficiency was obtained by using the high-efficiency CPV modules (∼31\% under the present operation conditions) and the direct connection between the CPV modules and the EC cells with an almost optimized number of elements in series. The STH efficiency bottleneck was clarified to be the efficiency of the CPV modules, the over-potential of the EC cells, and matching of the operation point to the maximal-power point of the CPV modules.}
